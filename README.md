# GuessWhichHand
A game made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
Click on one of the dog's paws to get candies.

Future modifications : 
- Add removeEventListener() to avoid decision change after the first click;
- Implement candy counter;
- Add UI tutorial animation (to encourage the user clicking on dog's paws)...
